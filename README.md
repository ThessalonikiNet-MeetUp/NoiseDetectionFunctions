# NoiseDetectionFunctions

These are Azure Functions specific to the implementation of the NoiseDetectionBot. These functions are to be triggered by both the [NoiseDetectionBot](https://github.com/ThessalonikiNet-MeetUp/NoiseDetectionBot) component and the [NoiseDetectionClient](https://github.com/ThessalonikiNet-MeetUp/NoiseDetectionClient) component to save and retrieve bot user information and to send notifications to users when noise has been detected respectively.
